# Transcripts and text-based editing

FilmCraft's Text panel ▸ **Transcript** tab shows the dialogue of the open sequence or Source clip as text. Use **Sequence** / **Source** to switch views. Double-click a word to correct its spelling; corrections preserve timing and speaker labels, support undo/redo, and are saved in the project. Source view also works for subclips, using the parent media's transcript. Select
words to mark In/Out, then extract or lift them; remove filler words and long pauses in one step;
turn the transcript into captions. Every action is an engine command (`transcript.*`), so the CLI,
the control channel and MCP agents can do the same.

## Model

- A **transcript** belongs to a media item (`Project::transcripts`, saved in the `.fcproj` since
  schema v9). It lists **words** with media-time bounds (`Tick`s), an optional speaker index and a
  confidence, plus the speaker names and the language. Because the times are media time, the
  transcript stays valid however the clip is trimmed, moved, sped up or reused.
- The **sequence transcript** is derived, never stored (`filmcraft_edit::transcript::sequence_words`):
  audio tracks are read top first; a word is heard through the first enabled clip whose range
  covers the word's midpoint (duplicates of the same dialogue on lower tracks read once); disabled,
  reversed and frame-hold clips contribute nothing.
- Speaker names come from the clip transcripts, so renaming "Speaker 1" in every transcript renames
  it across the sequence.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `transcript.generate` | Transcribe media items (`items`, else the Project selection, else the media of the sequence's audio clips). Params: `model` (default `whisper-base`), `language` (`auto` = detect), `diarize`, `maxSpeakers`, `wait` (default true; false starts a background job). One undo step. |
| `transcript.set` | Store a transcript you bring (JSON: `language`, `speakers`, `words` with `text`/`start`/`end`/`speaker`); it is sorted and made well formed. |
| `transcript.delete` | Remove transcripts. |
| `transcript.inspect` | The sequence transcript: words (index, text, sequence times, speaker, clip), paragraphs, speakers, the word at the playhead. |
| `transcript.source` | Words for the open Source clip in media time, restricted to its subclip range. |
| `transcript.correctWord` | Correct one word by root `item`, original transcript `index`, and `text`; optional `expected` prevents stale corrections. One nonempty word, up to 1024 bytes. |
| `transcript.search` | Word-index ranges matching a phrase (case and punctuation ignored; the last word may be a prefix). |
| `transcript.select` | Mark In/Out around words `from..=to` (frame-snapped outward) and move the playhead there. |
| `transcript.extract` / `transcript.lift` | Extract (ripple) or lift the words' frames on the targeted tracks. |
| `transcript.renameSpeaker` | Rename a speaker by name (every transcript) or by index in one `item`. |
| `transcript.removeFillers` | Ripple-delete filler words (`fillers`, default um/uh/erm/…; phrases such as "you know" allowed). |
| `transcript.removePauses` | Ripple-delete pauses longer than `minSeconds`, keeping `keepSeconds` of air on both sides. |
| `transcript.createCaptions` | Lay the words out as captions on a new caption track (`maxChars`, `lines`, `minSeconds`, `maxSeconds`, `gapFrames`). |
| `transcript.models` / `transcript.downloadModel` | List the speech models (size, licence, installed) / download one (`wait` defaults true; false returns a job). |

## Speech recognition

Recognition goes through the `Transcriber` trait (`crates/speech`). The built-in recogniser is
OpenAI's Whisper, run in pure Rust on [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) on the CPU,
with timestamp decoding, language detection and word times from cross-attention alignment (see the
`filmcraft_speech::whisper` module docs). Speakers are labelled by clustering per-chunk MFCC
statistics (`filmcraft_speech::diarize`); no model is involved.

Both are **optional features**, off by default and never built for the web:

- `whisper` (on `filmcraft-speech`, `filmcraft-engine`, and the `filmcraft` / `filmcraft-cli`
  apps, where it also enables downloads): candle inference.
- `download` (`speech-download` on the engine): HTTPS downloads with rustls + RustCrypto and the
  operating system's certificate verifier.

Without `whisper`, and with no recogniser installed, `transcript.generate` and Transcribe Sequence
are disabled, with "speech-to-text is not available in this build" as the reason (`describe`,
`command_list {"enabled_only": true}` and the menus show it); with Automatically transcribe clips
on, `file.import` reports the same reason as a `transcription: …` entry in its `errors`.
Without `speech-download`, `transcript.downloadModel` is disabled the same way. Transcripts can
still be imported with `transcript.set` and edited with every other command. Hosts and tests can
install any recogniser in `Session::transcriber`, which enables transcription in any build.

### Models

Weights are **never** bundled or committed. They are downloaded on request into
`<data dir>/models/<id>/` (see `filmcraft_engine::autosave::default_data_dir`), each file pinned to a
revision of OpenAI's Hugging Face repositories and checked against its SHA-256:

| Id | Languages | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| `whisper-tiny` | multilingual | MIT (OpenAI); HF conversion Apache-2.0 |
| `whisper-base` (default) | multilingual | MIT (OpenAI); HF conversion Apache-2.0 |
| `whisper-small` | multilingual | MIT (OpenAI); HF conversion Apache-2.0 |

### Desktop workflow

Open **Text ▸ Transcript ▸ Speech models** to explicitly download a model, then choose **Use model**. Model downloads and transcription run in background jobs in the desktop UI, including **Transcribe Sequence** and automatic transcription on import. The panel displays progress and a Cancel button; the Progress panel also lists these jobs. No audio is sent to a service.

For automation, `wait: true` keeps the synchronous command behavior. With `wait: false`, commands return a `job` ID; use `jobs.list` / `jobs.cancel`. Hosts must call `Session::poll_persistence` on their update loop to apply completed transcripts. Cancelled, failed, or stale results do not change the project. Opening another project cancels pending transcription. Multi-item transcription applies atomically as one undo step.

### Testing

Unit and engine tests use a fake `Transcriber` (`FixedTranscriber`), so CI needs no model. The
end-to-end test `crates/speech/tests/whisper_model.rs` (feature `whisper`) runs only when weights are
in `target/models/<id>/` (or `$FILMCRAFT_MODELS_DIR`) and speech samples (mono 16 kHz f32 with a
reference `.txt`) are in `target/fixtures/speech/`; it reports the word error rate and otherwise
prints SKIPPED. Measured on 2026-10-01: `whisper-tiny`, English, 12.2 % WER over 797 words of
the local speech samples (LibriSpeech read speech and dialogue clips) (about 9.5 minutes for the run in a release build on an
Apple-silicon laptop CPU).

## Limits

- One transcription job and one model download can run at a time.
- Audio is decoded in cancellable chunks, but inference retains the full mono source in memory; each media item is limited to one hour until streaming inference is available.
- Model loading and an individual decode/inference operation may finish before cancellation is observed.
- Source view supports navigation and spelling correction; extract, lift and caption creation use Sequence view.
- Correcting a word does not re-align it; inserting or removing transcript words is outside this workflow.
