# Captions

FilmCraft keeps captions on **caption tracks** in the sequence, shown in their own area above the
video tracks (as Premiere does). Caption tracks are saved in the `.fcproj` (project format
version 2; version 1 projects open with no caption tracks).

## Model

- **Caption track** (`CaptionTrack`, `crates/project/src/caption.rs`): name, format (`Subtitle`,
  `CEA-608`, `CEA-708`, `Teletext`), language, output eye (shown in the Program monitor and
  burned in on export), lock, sync lock, and a **track style**:
  font size (pixels at 1080 lines, scaled to the frame), text colour, background box and its colour,
  outline width and colour, alignment (left/centre/right), position (top/middle/bottom) and
  margin (a fraction of the frame height, default 0.08; `captions.setStyle` clamps it to 0–0.45),
  line spacing.
- **Caption**: in/out in exact `Tick`s, text (lines separated by `\n`; `<i>`, `<b>`, `<u>` kept
  as written), optional speaker, and the WebVTT cue id and cue settings, kept for round trips.
  Captions on a track never overlap.

## Files

| Format | Import | Export | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| SubRip `.srt` | ✓ | ✓ | Forgiving reader (BOM, UTF-16, Windows-1252, CRLF, missing indexes, `,`/`.` ms, missing hours). |
| WebVTT `.vtt` | ✓ | ✓ | Keeps cue ids, cue settings, `<v Speaker>`, STYLE/REGION/NOTE blocks. `line:N%` and `align:` are honoured when drawing. |
| Scenarist SCC `.scc` | ✓ | ✓ | CEA-608 at 29.97 fps. Reads pop-on, roll-up and paint-on; writes pop-on with drop-frame (default) or non-drop timecode. |

`File ▸ Import` (or dropping a file) recognises caption files by extension and content and adds a
new caption track to the open sequence (a sequence is created when none is open). Cue times are
snapped to the sequence's frames. `File ▸ Export ▸ Captions…` writes the chosen caption track in
the format given by the file extension (`.srt`, `.vtt`, `.scc`).

Details of each format and the SCC encoder are in [`crates/captions/README.md`](../crates/captions/README.md).

## Editing

| Command | Menu / shortcut | Params |
|---|---|---|
| `captions.newTrack` | Sequence ▸ Captions ▸ Add New Caption Track… (⌥⌘A) | `format`, `name`, `language` |
| `captions.add` | Sequence ▸ Captions ▸ Add Caption at Playhead (⌥⌘C) | `track`, `text`, `time`, `durationSeconds` (3) |
| `captions.next` / `captions.previous` | Sequence ▸ Captions ▸ Go to Next/Previous Caption Segment (⌥⌘↓/↑) | |
| `captions.showAll` / `captions.hideAll` | Sequence ▸ Captions | |
| `captions.split` | Text panel ✂ | `caption`, `time` (default: every caption under the playhead) |
| `captions.merge` | Text panel | `captions` (consecutive, one track) |
| `captions.setText` | Text panel text field | `caption`, `text`, `speaker` |
| `captions.setTimes` | Text panel in/out fields | `caption`, `start…`/`end…` (`Time` ticks, `Frame`, `Seconds`, `Timecode`) |
| `captions.trim` | drag a caption edge in the timeline | `caption`, `edge` (`in`/`out`), `delta` or `deltaFrames` |
| `captions.move` | drag a caption in the timeline | `captions`, `delta` or `deltaFrames` |
| `captions.delete` | Edit ▸ Clear / Ripple Delete with captions selected | `captions`, `ripple` |
| `captions.select`, `captions.goTo` | click / number button | `captions`, `add` / `caption` |
| `captions.setTrack` | caption track header (eye, lock) | `track`, `name`, `format`, `language`, `enabled`, `locked`, `syncLock` |
| `captions.setStyle` | Text panel style strip | `track`, `size`, `color`, `background`, `backgroundColor`, `outline`, `outlineColor`, `align`, `anchor`, `margin`, `lineSpacing`, `reset` |
| `captions.deleteTrack` | | `track` |
| `captions.import` / `captions.export` | File ▸ Export ▸ Captions… | `path`, `format`, `track`, `dropFrame` |
| `captions.list` | (query) | `track` — tracks, styles and captions with timecodes (a `track` that names no caption track is an error) |

Tracks are addressed by id or `"C1"`, `"C2"`… (top first). Edits are limited by neighbouring
captions and a one-frame minimum. Sync-locked caption tracks follow insert and extract edits on
the media tracks (a caption across an insert point is split). `Add Edit to All Tracks` (⇧⌘K)
also splits captions.

## Timeline and Text panel

- Caption rows: header with `C1…` badge, lock, output eye, name and format; caption blocks in
  violet showing their text. Click selects (⌘/⇧ adds), drag moves, edge drag trims, double-click
  opens the Text panel. Automation ids: `timeline.caption.<id>`,
  `timeline.captionTrack.C1[.locked|.enabled]`.
- **Text panel ▸ Captions**: search, track picker (also creates tracks of each format), add /
  split / merge / delete / export buttons, the list of segments with editable in/out timecodes
  and text (committed when the field loses focus), and the track style strip (size, colour, box,
  alignment, position). Automation ids: `text.tab.Captions`, `text.captions.add|split|merge|delete|export|search|track`,
  `text.captions.<id>.in|out|text|goto|row`, `text.captions.style.*`.

## Burn-in

The Program monitor shows the visible caption tracks. On export, `file.exportMedia`
`{"burnCaptions": true}` (Export mode: **Burn Captions Into Video**) draws them into every frame.
Captions are set in Inter SemiBold (OFL, bundled) by the text engine (`crates/text`: shaping,
kerning, bidi); italics/bold markup is not yet drawn differently. The captions of a nested sequence
are part of the nest's picture: they are drawn wherever the nest is shown, in the Program monitor
and in every export, whether or not the outer sequence shows or burns in its own.
