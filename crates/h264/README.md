# filmcraft-h264

Clean-room, pure-Rust (no `unsafe`) H.264 / AVC decoder, implemented from the public ITU-T
Rec. H.264 (ISO/IEC 14496-10) specification (edition 04/2017). It is an L0 crate: it depends only on
`filmcraft-bitstream`, `thiserror`, and optionally `rayon` (default feature `threads`), and builds
for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

All syntax tables (CAVLC code tables, the 1024 CABAC `(m, n)` context initialisation pairs,
`rangeTabLPS`, scaling defaults, deblocking thresholds, the 8x8 significance-map tables) were
extracted from the specification text (the extraction scripts only read the ITU-T PDF). No code was
taken or ported from FFmpeg, x264, JM or openh264. ffmpeg/libx264 are only used as external test
oracles and fixture generators.

## Supported

- NAL units: Annex-B byte streams and length-prefixed (`avcC`) samples; SPS (all fields incl.
  VUI/HRD, scaling lists with fall-back rules A/B, cropping, high-profile fields), PPS (incl.
  `transform_8x8_mode`, scaling lists, slice groups parsed), SEI / AUD / filler skipped.
- Slice header: all fields incl. reference list modification, prediction weight table and
  decoded reference picture marking. POC types 0, 1, 2. `frame_num` gap handling ("non-existing"
  frames).
- Entropy coding: CAVLC and CABAC (all syntax elements needed for frame coding, 4:2:0 and 4:2:2).
- Bit depths 8 to 10 and chroma formats 4:2:0 and 4:2:2 (Baseline / Main / High / High 10 /
  High 4:2:2 profiles; 10-bit camera material such as Panasonic Lumix MOV
  `H264_422_LongGOP` decodes bit-exactly).
- Macroblocks: I (Intra 4x4 / 8x8 / 16x16, I_PCM), P (all partitions, P_8x8ref0, P_Skip),
  B (all partitions and sub-partitions, B_Skip, B_Direct_16x16, B_Direct_8x8), spatial and temporal
  direct prediction with/without `direct_8x8_inference`, constrained intra prediction.
- Transforms / quantisation: 4x4, 8x8, Intra16x16 DC Hadamard, 2x2 (4:2:0) and 2x4 (4:2:2) chroma
  DC; flat and custom scaling matrices (SPS and PPS level); bit-depth-aware scaling
  (`QP′ = QP + QpBdOffset`).
- Inter prediction: quarter-sample 6-tap luma, chroma interpolation per ChromaArrayType (4:2:0
  eighth-sample, 4:2:2 quarter-sample vertical), explicit and implicit weighted prediction
  (offsets scaled to the bit depth per 8.4.3), multiple reference frames, long-term references.
- DPB: sliding window, all MMCOs (1-6), IDR / `no_output_of_prior_pics`, bumping with DPB size from
  the level (or VUI `max_dec_frame_buffering`) and `max_num_reorder_frames`.
- Deblocking filter: full bS derivation, `disable_deblocking_filter_idc` 0/1/2, slice offsets,
  8x8-transform edges.
- Output: cropped planar 4:2:0 or 4:2:2 pictures in output order with the caller's `pts`, POC, key
  flag, VUI colour description (range, primaries, transfer, matrix) and sample aspect ratio;
  8-bit streams come out as `u8` planes and deeper ones as `u16` (`Picture::bit_depth`).
- Frame-level multithreading (see below).
- Draft mode for reduced-resolution playback (off by default): non-reference pictures skip the
  deblocking filter and are flagged `Picture::draft`; every other picture stays bit-exact.

## API

```rust
use filmcraft_h264::Decoder;

let mut dec = Decoder::new(); // or Decoder::with_threads(n), Decoder::from_avcc(&avcc)?
// dec.threads(): worker threads in use; dec.set_draft(true): draft mode (playback only)
for (pts, access_unit) in access_units {
    for pic in dec.decode(access_unit, pts)? {
        // pic.width / pic.height (cropped), pic.y / pic.u / pic.v, pic.y_stride / pic.uv_stride,
        // pic.pts, pic.poc, pic.key, pic.color, pic.sar
    }
}
for pic in dec.flush() { /* ... */ }
if let Some(err) = dec.take_error() { /* error reported by a decoding thread */ }
```

`decode` expects whole access units (a buffer with several complete access units — e.g. an
entire Annex-B file — also works). `Decoder::stats()` returns counters of the coding tools seen
(macroblock types, slice types, MMCOs, long-term marks, frame_num gaps, ...).

### Threading model

The calling thread parses headers and performs all POC / DPB / reference-list bookkeeping (it only
needs header data). The macroblock layer of each picture is decoded as a job on a rayon pool. A job
reconstructs into private buffers, deblocks each macroblock row once the row below it is
reconstructed, and publishes finished rows (samples + motion data for co-located lookups) into the
picture's shared `Frame` (`OnceLock` per macroblock row). Jobs of later pictures block per row on
exactly the reference rows they read, so many pictures decode concurrently while the output stays
bit-exact. Without the `threads` feature (or on wasm, or with `with_threads(1)`) jobs run inline.
With threads, `decode` returns pictures once their job has finished, so output lags input by up to
roughly the number of threads.

Deblocking is row-parallel in this pipelined form: each picture's job filters macroblock row r as
soon as row r + 1 is reconstructed (intra prediction of row r + 1 reads the unfiltered bottom
line of row r) and publishes it one row later, while the jobs of other pictures run on other
threads. A picture waiting on a reference therefore waits only for that reference's rows its
motion vectors reach plus about two rows, so a chain of reference pictures (a seek from an IDR
picture) advances a few rows behind its predecessor instead of a whole picture behind it. A
separate deblocking thread per picture would shorten that lag by about one row and would need its
own copy of the reconstructed rows and macroblock state; it is not worth it while the pool has
more pictures in flight than cores. The hot loops are written to vectorise without `unsafe` or
intrinsics: the edge filters process all 16 (luma) or 8 (chroma) lines of an edge at once with
per-lane masks, the inverse transforms do their column pass across all columns, and the CABAC
engine decodes a context-coded bin without branching on its outcome.

### Draft mode

`Decoder::set_draft(true)` (reduced-resolution playback only; FilmCraft enables it with Settings ▸
Playback ▸ Draft decoding while the Program monitor plays at 1/2 or 1/4 resolution) skips the
deblocking filter (8.7) of non-reference pictures (`nal_ref_idc` 0). No picture is predicted from
a non-reference picture, and deblocking never changes the motion data that direct prediction
reads, so every other picture is unchanged; the skipped pictures are flagged `Picture::draft` and
the media stack never hands them to a paused monitor, a render or an export. On the 4K fixture
below it saves ~9 % of the decoding work (the B-pyramid's non-reference half of the B pictures).

## Tests

`cargo test -p filmcraft-h264` (fixtures are generated on first use into `target/fixtures/h264/`
with ffmpeg + libx264; tests print a message and skip when `/opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg` is absent).

- Unit tests: CAVLC tables (prefix-freeness / Kraft sums, spec-style residual example), CABAC engine
  (context init formula, round trip against an encoder model), intra predictors with hand-computed
  values, transforms, luma interpolation against a straightforward reference implementation,
  weighting, macroblock type tables, scaling-list parsing.
- Synthetic streams (`src/synth_tests.rs`): hand-built CAVLC and CABAC bitstreams covering what
  libx264 never produces — I_PCM, long-term references, MMCO 1-6, `frame_num` gaps, reference list
  modification (short- and long-term), explicit weighted prediction in P and B slices, B_Skip with
  explicit bi-prediction. The expected output is known exactly and is also checked against ffmpeg.
- Robustness: avcC input with pts round trip; randomly corrupted, truncated and garbage input never
  panics or deadlocks (single- and multi-threaded).
- Conformance (`tests/conformance.rs`): every fixture is decoded single-threaded, with 3 threads
  and with every core, and compared byte-for-byte with `ffmpeg -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p`; on
  mismatch the first differing frame, plane, sample position and macroblock are reported. Output
  pts/POC order is checked too, and that no picture is flagged draft without draft mode. Draft
  mode (`draft_mode_changes_only_flagged_non_reference_pictures`): on five B-pyramid / B-frame
  fixtures, single- and frame-threaded, every unflagged picture is bit-exact and only flagged
  pictures differ.
- Vectorised kernels against their straightforward forms on random input: the deblocking edge
  filter against the per-line filter, the 4x4 / 8x8 inverse transforms against the per-column
  formulation.

### Fixture matrix (all bit-exact, single- and multi-threaded)

libx264 fixtures unless noted; the VideoToolbox (hardware encoder) fixtures are skipped where that
encoder is unavailable.

## Performance

`cargo test --release -p filmcraft-h264 --test perf -- --ignored --nocapture` (1080p High profile,
CABAC, B-pyramid, 120 frames, 8.8 Mbit/s; bit-exactness is verified first). Measured on an Apple M4
Pro (14 cores) while the machine was heavily shared (load average 40-180), so these are lower bounds:

| threads | fps |
|---|---|
| 1 | ~105-122 (≈ 33 Mcycles per frame) |
| 14 | ~500-600 |

4K High profile (testsrc2 + grain, 3840x2160, CABAC, B-pyramid, ~170 Mbit/s; the first 48 frames
of the playback benchmark's `a2160.mp4`), CPU cycles per frame counted by the kernel
(`proc_pid_rusage`; independent of machine load, all threads summed; bit-exact with ffmpeg):

| build | Mcycles / frame | instructions / frame |
|---|---|---|
| before M4.9 | 505 | 1232 M |
| M4.9 | **390** (−23 %) | 1195 M |
| M4.9, draft mode | **356** (−30 %) | 1068 M |

The same on the benchmark's 1080p fixture (`dec_h264_1080.mp4`, 120 frames): 132 → 100 Mcycles
per frame (−24 %), 90 in draft mode. Single-threaded 4K time (`sample` profile) splits into CABAC
residual decoding 41 %, deblocking 16 % (25-30 % before), other macroblock-layer parsing 11 %,
inverse transforms and dequantisation 9 %, motion compensation 8 %, intra prediction 6 %, row and
picture copies 4 %. At ~4.5 GHz a 4K frame takes ~85 ms of one
core, so 23.976 fps needs about two cores' worth of frame threads.

The example `cargo run --release -p filmcraft-h264 --example h264dec -- in.h264 out.yuv` decodes a
file; `H264_BENCH_ITERS=n` (and `H264_THREADS=t`, `H264_DRAFT=1`) turns it into a benchmark,
`H264_STATS=1` prints the coverage counters.

## Known gaps

- Interlaced coding (field pictures, PAFF, MBAFF): streams with `frame_mbs_only_flag = 0` return
  `Error::Unsupported`.
- 4:4:4 / monochrome (ChromaArrayType 0 and 3) and lossless
  (`qpprime_y_zero_transform_bypass`) return `Error::Unsupported`.
- FMO (slice groups), SP/SI slices, data partitioning (Extended profile), MVC/SVC NAL units.
- Error concealment is minimal: undecodable slices leave the prediction/previous content; missing
  references are replaced by other references.
- No SIMD intrinsics (the hot loops are written to auto-vectorise); CABAC residual decoding is
  inherently serial and now dominates.

### Notes on the 8- to 10-bit / 4:2:0 to 4:2:2 support

Samples are `u16` for every bit depth (like `filmcraft-hevc`); 8-bit streams are narrowed when the
picture is output. The format-specific corners follow ITU-T H.264 (04/2017): residual scaling
uses the effective QP (`QP′ = QP + QpBdOffset`, 7-38 / 8-312), weighted-prediction offsets are
scaled in the weight derivation (8-291/8-292/8-296/8-297), the 4:2:2 chroma DC block is 2x4 with
scan-order remapping (8-305) and `qPDC = qP + 3` scaling (8-327..8-329), chroma 4x4 blocks are
indexed `x = (idx % 2) * 4, y = (idx / 2) * 4` in both formats (6.4.7), 4:2:2 intra chroma predicts
the whole 8x16 block (8.3.4, Plane uses `yCF = 4`), 4:2:2 motion compensation keeps the luma
motion vector with `yFracC = (mv & 3) << 1` (8-231..8-234), and the deblocking filter scales its
thresholds by `1 << (BitDepth - 8)` while indexing the tables with the raw QPY/QPC (8.7.2.2),
filtering the 4:2:2 chroma edges yE = 0, 4, 8, 12 regardless of `transform_size_8x8_flag`
(8.7, Figure 8-10). `mb_qp_delta` is bounded by the *result* it derives, not by its own magnitude:
7-4 keeps `QPY` inside `-QpBdOffsetY..=51`, so a deep bit depth lets one delta legitimately move
more than the 8-bit `-26..=25` (a 10-bit stream may carry `51 + 12`), and equation 7-10 wraps the
result over `52 + QpBdOffsetY` values. Bit-exactness is proven against ffmpeg oracle fixtures
(`high10_*`, `high422_*` in `tests/conformance.rs`, including the unfiltered `*_clean` pair that
walks the full delta range) and real camera material (Panasonic Lumix S5 MOV, H.264 High 4:2:2
10-bit LongGOP, 4K25).
